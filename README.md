# Mini Golf Captcha for Kitboga Code Jam

This is my submission for the [Kitboga Code Jam 2025](https://kitboga.com/codejam).

This is a CAPTCHA, where the user has to complete a 2D minigolf course to get verified. It is simple, fun, and not too difficult.

It may be scuffed on mobile phones, but it works well on desktop browsers.

## Getting Started

### Online

1. Open the live demo at <https://lunarmossy.github.io/kitboga-code-jam/> in your browser.

### Local

1. Clone the new repository locally to your machine
2. Open the "game shell" in your browser; this can be done in 2 ways:
   - By opening `index.html` directly in your browser
   - By running a local webserver (this can help with testing on different devices too). One easy way to do this, if you have python installed, is to run this command in the terminal: `python3 -m http.server 8000`. Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser (the port may vary if you used a different method to start a web server).
